   abstract = {<p> Flexible and bendable electronics are gaining a lot of interest in these last years. In this scenario, compact antennas on flexible substrates represent a strategical technological step to pave the way to a new class of wearable systems. A crucial issue to overcome is represented by the poor radiation properties of compact antennas, especially in the case of flexible and thin substrates. In this paper, we propose an innovative design of a miniaturized evolved patch antenna whose radiation properties have been enhanced with a Split Ring Resonator (SRR) placed between the top and the ground plane. The antenna has been realized on a flexible and biocompatible substrate polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) of 250 μm by means of a new fabrication protocol that involves a three-layer 3D-inkjet printing and an alignment step. The antenna has been characterized in terms of the scattering parameter S <sub>11</sub> and the radiation pattern showing a good agreement between simulations and measurements. </p>},

    abstract = {The fitness of a population is defined to be a real smooth function of its environment and phenotype. Darwin's law of natural selection implies that a population in equilibrium with its environment under natural selection will have a phenotype which maximizes the fitness locally. By using Thom theory it is possible under a number of assumptions to make qualitative inferences about the phenotypic change of a population subject to natural selection in a continuously varying environment. When the environment is one or two dimensional, Thom's catastrophe theorem implies that sudden and substantial changes in phenotype can only arise from the fold and cusp catastrophes. It is shown that a population in stable equilibrium with its environment exhibits genetic assimilation, and that the main modes of evolution can arise from appropriate variations in the environment.}

   abstract = {<p>Targeting quasar candidates is always an important task for large spectroscopic sky survey projects. Astronomers never give up thinking out effective approaches to separate quasars from stars. The previous methods on this issue almost belong to supervised methods or color-color cut. In this work, we compare the performance of a supervised method – Support Vector Machine (SVM)– with that of an unsupervised method one-class SVM. The performance of SVM is better than that of one-class SVM. But one-class SVM is an unsupervised algorithm which is helpful to recognize rare or mysterious objects. Combining supervised methods with unsupervised methods is effective to improve the performance of a single classifier.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The heavenly bodies are objects that swim in the outer space. The classification of these objects is a challenging task for astronomers. This article presents a novel methodology that enables an efficient and accurate classification of cosmic objects (3 classes) based on evolutionary optimization of classifiers. This research collected the data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey database. In this work, we are proposing to develop a novel machine learning model to classify stellar spectra of stars, quasars and galaxies. First, the input data are normalized and then subjected to principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality. Then, the genetic algorithm is implemented on the data which helps to find the optimal parameters for the classifiers. We have used 21 classifiers to develop an accurate and robust classification with fivefold cross-validation strategy. Our developed model has achieved an improvement in the accuracy using nineteen out of twenty-one models. We have obtained the highest classification accuracy of 99.16\%, precision of 98.78\%, recall of 98.08\% and F1-score of 98.32\% using evolutionary system based on voting classifier. The developed machine learning prototype can help the astronomers to make accurate classification of heavenly bodies in the sky. Proposed evolutionary system can be used in other areas where accurate classification of many classes is required.</p>},

@article{Kim2016,
   abstract = {Most existing star-galaxy classifiers use the reduced summary information from catalogs, requiring careful feature extraction and selection. The latest advances in machine learning that use deep convolutional neural networks allow a machine to automatically learn the features directly from data, minimizing the need for input from human experts. We present a star-galaxy classification framework that uses deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) directly on the reduced, calibrated pixel values. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS), we demonstrate that ConvNets are able to produce accurate and well-calibrated probabilistic classifications that are competitive with conventional machine learning techniques. Future advances in deep learning may bring more success with current and forthcoming photometric surveys, such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), because deep neural networks require very little, manual feature engineering.},
